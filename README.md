# Gardeners Plantiing System 1.0
 
This is the first edition of the Gardener's Planting System. It was written in about 2018, if not earlier, and represents stable, flat file development for really simple Web pages.

After the application is considered robust, for the platform on which it was designed, all that remains is to add data to the files as the opportunity presents itself.

Most of the description of the site has been included in its pages, instead of in the README.txt file.

It has been replaced with the edition that uses a database for its information, instead of this flat file system. However, the web page is still usable.
