  Hello!<br>

I have always been in Information Technologies in one facet or another. I designed, developed, documented, and deployed computer systems for several years.  I have worked in aerospace, education, hospitals, insurance, publishing, software and telecommunications. I taught the Cook's tour of computer science for about 3 years; students appreciate the survey that uses competency-based education techniques to empower student-centered learning.

My Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is from Western Washington University, my Masters in Education is from the University of Washington Bothell, and I have certificates in Project Management  and Web and Mobile Design.

  <div class="heroText">About the Website </div>
 
Growers Planning Solutions is a fictitious company, designed for the purpose of making a really cool logo whose acronym is the same as the site.

The site was prototyped for the Lake Washington Institute of Technologies DreamWeaver class, DSGN 233.

At the moment it runs on a rudimentary file system, but it was built so that changing to a database is in alignment with the design.

The purpose of the website was to have everything the average gardener needs to know about plants that they are likely to grow.  It is of assistance in purchasing and landscaping decisions, without running all over the Internet seeking answers.

The user can pick a type of plant on the main page, and then display different types of information about that plant on any of several  pages.

The Gardener's Planting System website is also available at www.ormer.net/gps.
